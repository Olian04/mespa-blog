# Multi-Entry Single-Page-Application (blog)

Maybe goal usage? (haven't decided yet):

1. Download ZIP of project & unzip in some folder.
2. Run "mespa-blog.exe".
3. Log in to github account.
4. Either create a new reop or select an exsisting repo.
5. (if exsisting reop) Select source branch and host branch.
6. Create new blog entry, or edit existing onces.
7. Save (will push changes to source branch).
8. Publish (will build blog and push changes to host branch).
